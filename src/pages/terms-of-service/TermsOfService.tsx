              <h2>1. Services</h2>
              <p>
                http://Devinity.AI LLC provides software development services,
                including but not limited to AI model development, application
                development, and consultancy services. The specific services to
                be provided will be outlined in individual project agreements or
                statements of work ("SOW").
              </p>
              <h2>2. Payment Terms</h2>
              <h4>2.1 Escrow Payments:</h4>
              <p>
                All payments for services will be managed through the escrow
                services provided by platforms like Upwork. The client agrees to
                fund the escrow account as per the payment schedule outlined in
                the SOW before the commencement of any work.
              </p>

              <h4>2.2 Release of Funds:</h4>
              <p>
                Payments will be released from the escrow account to
                http://Devinity.AI LLC upon the completion of agreed-upon
                milestones and client approval.
              </p>

              <h4>2.3 Disputes:</h4>
              <p>
                Any payment disputes will be handled in accordance with the
                dispute resolution policies of the escrow service platform.
              </p>

              <h4>2.4 Additional Charges:</h4>
              <p>
                Any additional charges for changes or modifications will be
                communicated to the client, and the client agrees to fund the
                escrow account accordingly before work on these changes begins.
              </p>

              <h4>2.5 Fees and Other Charges:</h4>
              <p>
                Matters pertaining to transactions (via escrows), legal
                obligations, and commissions shall be governed by Upwork's terms
                of service. Any commission incurred through escrowâ€™s platform
                shall not fall under our purview.
              </p>

              <h2>3. Project Scope and Changes</h2>
              <h4>3.1 Scope:</h4>
              <p>
                The scope of the project will be defined in the SOW. Any changes
                to the scope must be agreed upon in writing by both parties.
              </p>
              <h4>3.2 Additions:</h4>
              <p>
                The client agrees not to request any additions to the
                pre-approved milestones post initiation of the project.
              </p>
              <h4>3.3 Change Requests:</h4>
              <p>
                Any additions may be charged at a rate of $22 per hour. We will
                warn the client of potential charges before starting work on
                additions.
              </p>
              <h4>3.4 Substantial Changes:</h4>
              <p>
                If the client requests changes or modifications that will take
                more than a third of the original milestone projected time,
                http://Devinity.AI LLC reserves the right to refuse service or
                undertake the work at a rate of $110 per day or $22 per hour.
              </p>
              <h4>3.5 Accumulated Small Changes:</h4>
              <p>
                Small changes that accumulate over time will be tracked. Work
                will stop on any changes or modifications whenever the time
                spent reaches a third of the original milestone projected time,
                even if some work is stopped mid-completion.
              </p>
              <h4>3.6 App Store Modifications and Rejections:</h4>
              <p>
                http://Devinity.AI is not responsible for any significant
                modifications requested by app stores or for the rejection of
                the app by these platforms. The responsibility for addressing
                such requests or rejections falls to the client.
              </p>
              <h4>3.7 Design Stage:</h4>
              <p>
                During the design phase, http://Devinity.AI LLC reserves the
                right to either refuse service or modify the Statement of Work
                (SOW) if it becomes apparent that, due to the complexity of the
                design, the time required to complete the milestone or project
                will significantly exceed the initially projected timeline.
              </p>
              <h4>3.8 Reserve Period:</h4>
              <p>
                http://Devinity.AI LLC maintains a reserve period of up to a
                third of the initially projected timeline for each milestone. If
                the duration of work extends beyond this reserve period (e.g.,
                exceeding 13 days on a 10-day projected timeline) due to
                client-requested changes or other factors, http://Devinity.AI
                LLC reserves the right to either refuse service or bill the
                client at a rate of $22 per hour for each additional hour
                worked. The client will be notified in advance of these
                potential charges.
              </p>
              <h2>4. Client Responsibilities</h2>
              <h4>4.1 Access:</h4>
              <p>
                The client must provide http://Devinity.AI LLC with timely
                access (within 2 working days by default or other mutually
                agreed duration) to necessary platforms, resources, and
                information to complete the project. Although http://Devinity.AI
                LLC will source the personnel required for the project, the
                client is responsible for ensuring that access to these
                platforms and resources is granted promptly.
              </p>
              <h4>4.2 Feedback:</h4>
              <p>
                The client agrees to provide timely feedback and approvals to
                avoid delays in the project timeline.
              </p>

                Unless otherwise agreed in writing, all intellectual property
                rights in the deliverables created during the project will
                remain with http://Devinity.AI LLC until full payment is
                received.
              </p>
              <h4>5.2 License:</h4>
              <p>
                Upon full payment, the client will receive a non-exclusive,
                non-transferable license to use the deliverables for their
                intended purpose.
              </p>

              <p>
                Both parties agree to keep confidential any proprietary
                information, trade secrets, or other sensitive information

              <h4>6.2 Non-Disclosure:</h4>
              <p>
                Confidential information shall not be disclosed to any third
                party without the prior written consent of the disclosing party.
              </p>

              <p>
                Either party may terminate the agreement for any reason with 30
                days written notice.
              </p>
              <h4>9.2 Termination for Cause:</h4>
              <p>
                Either party may terminate the agreement immediately if the

                to cure such breach within 15 days of written notice.

              <p>

              </p>
              <h2>10. Dispute Resolution</h2>
              <h4>10.1 Mediation:</h4>
              <p>
                In the event of a dispute, the parties agree to first attempt to
                resolve the dispute through mediation.
              </p>
              <h4>10.2 Arbitration:</h4>

              <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>

              </p>

              <h2>12. Miscellaneous</h2>
              <h4>12.1 Projected Timelines:</h4>
              <p>
                The client understands that projected timelines are only
                projections and may be subject to external forces or unforeseen
                circumstances.
              </p>
              <h4>12.2 Third-Party APIs:</h4>
              <p>
                The client acknowledges the inherent limitations associated with
                utilizing third-party APIs and understands that achieving a
                fully customized solution may be constrained by these
                limitations.
              </p>
              <h4>12.3 API Changes:</h4>
              <p>
                The client understands that transitioning from one API or
                service provider to another necessitates significant time and
                effort. If the cumulative time required for such a
                transitionâ€”including all prior modificationsâ€”exceeds one-third
                of the original milestone's projected time, the client agrees to
                compensate http://Devinity.AI LLC at a rate of $110 per day or
                $22 per hour.
              </p>
              <h4>12.4 Bug Fixes:</h4>
              <p>
                Bug fixes are not categorized as modifications or changes.
                Therefore, the policy regarding the time spent on modifications,
                which stipulates a limit of one-third of the milestone's
                projected time, does not apply to bug fixes.
              </p>
              <h4>12.5 Entire Agreement:</h4>
              <p>
                These Terms, along with any SOWs, constitute the entire
                agreement between the parties and supersede all prior agreements
                or understandings.
              </p>
              <h4>12.6 Amendments:</h4>
              <p>
                Any amendments to these Terms must be in writing and signed by
                both parties.
              </p>
              <h4>12.7 Severability:</h4>
              <p>
                If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable,
                the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and
                effect.
              </p>
              <h4>12.8 Waiver:</h4>
              <p>
                The failure of either party to enforce any right or provision of
                these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
                provision.
              </p>
              <h4>12.9 Revision of TOS:</h4>
              <p>
                These Terms of Service are subject to ongoing review and may be
                updated at any time. All projects will be conducted in
                accordance with the latest version of the Terms of Service.
