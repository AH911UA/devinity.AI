It operates without a central authority, relying on consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) to validate transactions.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Key features</b>
<ul>
<li>Decentralisation: No central authority</li>
<li>Consensus Mechanisms: Methods like PoW and PoW ensure agreement on the ledger state.</li>
<li>Smart Contracts: Self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code, automating transactions.</li>
<li>Tokenisation: Digital representation of assets on the blockchain, facilitating ownership and transfer.</li></ul>"
