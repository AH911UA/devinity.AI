    {
      "question": "How much time does the development process usually take?",
      "answer": "Each project we undertake is distinctive, with its own set of requirements and scope. Development time can differ significantly, especially between websites and apps, primarily influenced by the level of desired functionality and the intricacy of the design. To provide a preliminary timeframe, we invite you to use our quote calculation tool available on our website. This tool takes into consideration various factors to give you a tailored estimate.",
      "open": true
    },
    {
      "question": "What technologies do you use?",
      "answer": "Our team boasts expertise in a wide array of technologies, ensuring we can meet the diverse needs of our clients. We exceed our customer’s expectations in the development of AI-powered mobile and web products. Specifically, our in-house experts are proficient in: React.js, React Native, Node.js, Electron, GraphQL, Apollo, MongoDB, SQL, REST APIs, WebSocket, MQTT, Stripe, LiqPay, Fondy, Unit Tests, Component Tests, API Testing, Arduino IDE, PHP, YII2, JavaScript (JS), jQuery, OpenAI API, Python, Gemini AI API, OpenAI Products, MapBox, Google Maps, Twilio and Xcode."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the cost of your services?",
      "answer": "We are dedicated to working within your budget and offer various pricing models based on the project's expertise requirements. Our standard hourly rate for a full-stack developer is $22, with a daily rate of $120. However, we typically prefer fixed-price, milestone-based arrangements to protect clients from unexpected charges and hourly rates."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does your work require prepayment?",
      "answer": "To initiate the development process, we typically require a prepayment in the range of $200 to $300. This initial step is essential for team assembly and the initial design phase, allowing us to align our resources effectively to meet your project's unique demands."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does your work require a pre-payment or a deposit?",
      "answer": "The payment terms depend on the client's preferences. We offer the option to work through escrow and mediation services like escrow.com or UpWork. Alternatively, if the client is a legal resident and taxpayer in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, or any EU country (excluding most Balkan and Baltic countries), we can proceed without a deposit or escrow, using an invoice-based approach. For clients outside these regions, a pre-payment of 50% is required before each milestone begins."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many people work on the project?",
      "answer": "The size of the development team depends on your project's timeline and urgency. Many projects can be completed within one month by a single developer. For more complex tasks, a team of 2-3 developers is often efficient. We are flexible and ready to scale our workforce up or down to ensure your project is delivered efficiently and to the highest standard."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you ensure the quality of your code?",
      "answer": "We ensure the quality of our code through extensive Quality Assurance (QA) processes and a commitment to continuous improvement (Kaizen). Our QA processes include rigorous testing at every stage of development, such as unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. We also conduct regular code reviews to maintain high coding standards and identify potential issues early. By embracing the principles of Kaizen, we continuously refine our development practices to enhance efficiency and quality."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle changes in project scope?",
      "answer": "We handle changes in project scope by pre-planning and outlining all work in a Statement of Work (SOW). The SOW is a detailed document that defines the project’s objectives, deliverables, timeline, and specific tasks. By adhering to the SOW, we ensure that both parties have a clear understanding of the project’s scope from the outset. Any changes to the scope are subject to review and approval by both parties, ensuring that all adjustments are managed in a controlled and transparent manner."
    },
    {
      "question": "What types of projects do you specialize in?",
      "answer": "We specialize in mobile, web, and AI integration projects. Our expertise particularly shines in OpenAI technologies, and we have a robust portfolio demonstrating our cutting-edge capabilities in this area. In addition to OpenAI, we also work extensively with Gemini AI and Mistral AI, allowing us to provide a comprehensive range of AI solutions tailored to your needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you ensure the project stays on schedule?",
      "answer": "We ensure the project stays on schedule by strictly adhering to the Statement of Work (SOW) and the defined project scope. By maintaining rigorous quality control and ensuring the product is bug-free at each iteration, we keep the project on track and prevent delays. This disciplined approach allows us to meet deadlines and deliver high-quality results consistently."
    },
    {
      "question": "What kind of support do you offer after the project is completed?",
      "answer": "We offer a complimentary 6-month support period after the project is completed, free of charge. During this time, we fix any bugs that may arise and provide limited DevOps support to ensure the smooth operation of your product."

      "description": "<div><h1>Blockchain</h1>\n\n  <p>Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology (DLT) that records data in a way that is secure, transparent, and tamper-proof. It is a revolutionary technology with the potential to transform many industries, including finance, healthcare, and supply chain management.</p>\n\n  <h2>What is a blockchain?</h2>\n\n  <p>A blockchain is a growing list of records (blocks) that are secured by cryptography. Each block contains a timestamp and a link to the previous block. This creates a chain of blocks that cannot be tampered with or altered.</p>\n\n  <p>Blockchains are typically managed by a network of computers, called nodes. These nodes verify and validate transactions before adding them to the blockchain. This ensures that the data on the blockchain is secure and accurate.</p>\n\n  <h2>How does blockchain work?</h2>\n\n  <p>Blockchain technology works through a process of consensus. This is a mechanism that ensures that all nodes in the network agree on the current state of the blockchain. There are many different consensus algorithms, but they all share the same goal of preventing fraud and ensuring the integrity of the data.</p>\n\n  <p>One of the most common consensus algorithms is Proof of Work (PoW). PoW requires miners to solve complex mathematical puzzles in order to add new blocks to the blockchain. This process is computationally expensive, but it helps to ensure that the network is secure and that no single node can control it.</p>\n\n  <h2>Benefits of blockchain</h2>\n\n  <p>Blockchain technology offers several benefits over traditional data storage methods. These include:</p>\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>Security: Blockchain data is secure from tampering and fraud because it is encrypted and dispersed across a network of computers.</li>\n    <li>Transparency: Blockchain records are transparent and can be viewed by anyone with access to the network. This makes it difficult to hide or manipulate data.</li>\n    <li>Immutability: Once data is added to the blockchain, it cannot be changed. This makes blockchain ideal for storing records that need to be tamper-proof, such as contracts and financial transactions.</li>\n    <li>Efficiency: Blockchain transactions are typically faster and cheaper than traditional transactions because they do not require intermediaries.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h2>Potential applications of blockchain</h2>\n\n  <p>Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize many industries, including:</p>\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>Finance: Blockchain can be used to create secure and transparent financial systems, such as cryptocurrency exchanges and smart contracts.</li>\n    <li>Healthcare: Blockchain can be used to store and share patient data securely, which could improve patient care and medical research.</li>\n    <li>Supply chain management: Blockchain can be used to track the movement of goods from source to destination, which could improve efficiency and reduce fraud.</li>\n    <li>Government: Blockchain can be used to create more transparent and accountable government systems.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <p>Blockchain technology is still in its early stages of development, but it has the potential to have a profound impact on the world. As the technology matures, we can expect to see it being used in a wider range of applications.</p>\n\n  <p>Disclaimer: This is not investment advice. Please do your own research before investing in any cryptocurrency or blockchain-based project.</p></div>",
